# Golden-Path Example

## Purpose

The golden-path example exists to prove that the architecture and template
are sufficient to implement a real feature.

It is not a tutorial and must not introduce special cases.

---

## Constraints

The example must:

- Be generated by the template with only name changes
- Compile under Swift 6
- Use SwiftUI and Observation
- Include all VIPER roles
- Demonstrate async flow and state updates

The example must not:

- Introduce additional abstractions
- Use UIKit
- Contain error handling
- Contain persistence or networking

---

## Role Usage

- The View renders Presenter-owned state
- The Presenter owns ViewState and formats data
- The Interactor performs async work using `Task.sleep`
- The Router exists even if unused
- Entities may be unused

---

## Acceptance Criteria

The example is valid only if:

- It builds without warnings
- Removing it does not affect the template
- No architectural rules were bent to support it

If the example requires explanation, it is invalid.
