This repository defines a strict architectural specification.

Before proposing changes:

1. Identify whether the change affects the specification, templates, or tooling
2. Justify why the existing rules are insufficient
3. Prefer tightening rules over loosening them

Changes that introduce flexibility, optionality, or alternative
architectural interpretations will be rejected.

This is intentional.
